NitroPC FAQ
===========

**Q:** What is the default hard-disk encryption password?
   The default NitroPC disk encryption password: "12345678". This was change on the 15.01.2024 so if "12345678" is not working try the old default: "PleaseChangeMe"

**Q:** How do I upgrade to the most recent BIOS/Firmware?

   Check the BIOS version by pressing ESC at boot, any BIOS version older than 2024 is not the most recent.
   
   **Notice**: two distinct versions exist, make sure to pick the right version. 
      Visit the coreboot-builder release page to upgrade https://github.com/Nitrokey/coreboot-builder/releases
   
   **Warning**: upgrading the BIOS/Firmware may brick your device, consider asking for support from Nitrokey or professionals to do so.
